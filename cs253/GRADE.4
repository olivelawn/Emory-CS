Build a little tree:
Insert(2) yields TRUE, good
Insert(1) yields TRUE, good
Insert(3) yields TRUE, good
Tree Size is 3, as expected

Here is the tree:

      3
   2
      1


Try to delete things not there ...
Delete(4) yields FALSE, good
Delete(0) yields FALSE, good
Tree Size is 3, as expected

Here is the tree:

      3
   2
      1


Destroy tree, root first:
Delete(2) yields TRUE, good
Delete(1) yields TRUE, good
Delete(3) yields TRUE, good
Tree Size is 0, as expected

Build it up again:
Insert(2) yields TRUE, good
Insert(1) yields TRUE, good
Insert(3) yields TRUE, good
Tree Size is 3, as expected

Here is the tree:

      3
   2
      1


Destroy tree again, leaves first:
Delete(1) yields TRUE, good
Delete(3) yields TRUE, good
Delete(2) yields TRUE, good
Tree Size is 0, as expected

Build a bigger tree:
Insert(6) yields TRUE, good
Insert(4) yields TRUE, good
Insert(5) yields TRUE, good
Insert(8) yields TRUE, good
Insert(7) yields TRUE, good
Insert(1) yields TRUE, good
Insert(2) yields TRUE, good

   6
         5
      4
            2
         1


Delete root, with two children:
Delete(6) yields TRUE, good
Delete(6) yields FALSE, good

Delete non-roots with children ...
Delete(4) yields TRUE, good

Here is the tree:

      9
   7
      5
            2
         1

Delete(1) yields TRUE, good
Delete(2) yields TRUE, good
Delete(7) yields TRUE, good
Delete(5) yields TRUE, good
Delete(9) yields TRUE, good
Tree Size is 0, as expected
Delete from empty tree:
Delete(1) yields FALSE, good

Delete solitary root node:
Insert(1) yields TRUE, good
Delete(1) yields TRUE, good
Tree Size is 0, as expected

Exiting with grade == 100

Raw total: 100/100
After grader penalty (5%), 95/100...
After any early/late adjustments (-10%)...
(the max is 100)
