in This assignment we were to make a spell checker.  The program 
speller.C takes in two files via the command line.  The first file is a 
dictionary file dict, and the second file can be any text file.  
Basically I used a hash table to store the data and then using a iterator 
I iterate through the table looking for the text word.

example input would be a.out dict text.
