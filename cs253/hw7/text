The LEDA library of efficient data types and algorithms is now available
via anonymous ftp.

SITE:  sbsvax.cs.uni-sb.de (134.96.252.31)

FILE:  /pub/LEDA/LEDA-<version>.tar.Z   (compressed tar file)


The distribution contains the following files and sub-directories:

        README            this file
        INSTALL           installation instructions
        Changes           most recent changes
        incl/             header files 
        src/              C++ sources
        prog/             example programs
        man/              user manual (TeX)
        report/           technical report (TeX)


LEDA currently can be used with the following C++ compilers:

AT&T  cfront 2.0
AT&T  cfront 2.1
GNU   g++-1.37.1  
GNU   g++-1.40.3  (NOT g++-1.39)

TURBO   C++        Due to space limitations only parts of the library  
BORLAND C++        can be compiled with TC++ or BC++ (all basic data types,
                   dictionaries, priority queues, graphs, most of the graph
                   algorithms, basic geometric objects), see INSTALL.dos for
                   details.



IMPORTANT:
