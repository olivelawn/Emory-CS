	* hw6.C: rearranged Graph::PathBFS() so that the caller provides a
 	List<int>&, rather than returning a List<int>.  The old version
 	was actually deallocating the linked list twice: before and after
 	it was printed out (a consequence of copying an object with a
 	destructor and external references).
